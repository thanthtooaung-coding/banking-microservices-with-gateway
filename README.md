# Banking Microservices (simplified)

This is a ready-to-run example repo for a Spring Boot microservices banking app using:
- Java 17, Maven
- Spring Boot 3.3.13, Spring Cloud 2023.0.5
- gRPC (proto files included) for service-to-service sync calls
- Kafka for events
- Single shared PostgreSQL database (Flyway migrations)
- Docker Compose for Postgres + Kafka (development)

How to run (quick):
1. Start infra:
   ```bash
   cd infra
   docker compose up -d
   ```
2. Build & run services (from repo root):
   ```bash
   # build each service
   cd user-service
   mvn -DskipTests package
   cd ../account-service
   mvn -DskipTests package
   cd ../gateway-service
   mvn -DskipTests package

   # run jars (in separate terminals)
   java -jar user-service/target/user-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   java -jar account-service/target/account-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   java -jar gateway-service/target/gateway-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```
3. Use the gateway endpoints:
   - POST /api/auth/register
   - POST /api/auth/login
   - POST /api/transfer

Note: gRPC stubs are generated by Maven during `mvn package` using the included `src/main/proto` files.
